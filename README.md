# GettingCleaningData

This project has been created in the scope of Coursera course called "Getting and Cleaning Data" (3rd course In data science specialization).

The project creates a tidy data set from an existing dataset.
A full description of the initial data set is available at the site: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The code book describes the features involved in the tidy data set (CodeBook.md).
The script run_analyzes.R is used to convert the initial data set into the tidy data set.
It does not use any parameter to ensure reproductibility.
